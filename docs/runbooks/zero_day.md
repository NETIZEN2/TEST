# Zero-day Vulnerability Runbook

Guidance for responding to an unpatched upstream vulnerability:

1. **Assess exposure** – inventory affected components and versions.
2. **Mitigate** – apply vendor mitigations or temporary controls.
3. **Monitor** – increase logging and watch threat intelligence feeds.
4. **Patch** – roll out official fixes when available, verifying in staging first.
5. **Review** – update threat models and dependency management policies.
